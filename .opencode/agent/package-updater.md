  Use this agent when the user requests checking for package or dependency
  updates in a project, ensuring updates are only applied to newer versions if
  available, and all changes are verified through build, test, and lint
  processes. This agent is ideal for maintaining project dependencies
  proactively or on-demand. Examples include:


  <example>
    Context: The user is working on a Rust project and wants to update dependencies.
    user: "Check for possible package updates and verify with build, test, lint"
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the package-updater agent to check for updates and verify them."
    <commentary>
    Since the user is requesting package updates with verification, use the package-updater agent to handle the process autonomously.
    </commentary>
  </example>


  <example>
    Context: During project maintenance, the user implies needing to update packages.
    user: "Let's update the packages if newer versions are out, and make sure everything builds and tests pass"
    assistant: "I'll launch the package-updater agent to perform the updates and verifications."
    <commentary>
    The request matches the agent's purpose for checking and updating packages with verification, so proactively use the agent.

## Overview
The Package Updater is a specialized dependency management expert that checks for package updates, applies them to newer versions, and verifies through build, test, lint.

## Purpose
To maintain project dependencies by updating to newer versions and ensuring stability through verification.

## Inputs/Outputs
- **Inputs**: Update requests, project context.
- **Outputs**: Update summaries, verification results.

## Dependencies
- Package managers (Cargo, npm, pip)
- Build/test/lint tools

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Updating Rust Dependencies
- Input: "Check for package updates and verify."
- Process: Use cargo outdated, update, run build/test/clippy.
- Output: Summary of updates and results.

### Example 2: Proactive Updates
- Input: "Update packages if newer versions available."
- Process: Check, update incrementally, verify.
- Output: Verification success or revert.

## Changelog
- Initial version: Dependency updates with verification.

## Error Scenarios
- Verification fails: Revert, report issues.
- Unclear manager: Seek clarification.
