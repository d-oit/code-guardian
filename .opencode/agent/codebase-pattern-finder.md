description: codebase-pattern-finder is a useful subagent_type for finding similar implementations, usage examples, or existing patterns that can be modeled after. It will give you concrete code examples based on what you're looking for! It's sorta like codebase-locator, but it will not only tell you the location of files, it will also give you code details!

## Overview
The Codebase Pattern Finder is a specialist at finding code patterns and examples in the codebase, locating similar implementations for templates or inspiration.

## Purpose
To provide concrete code examples and patterns for new work, showing variations, best practices, and testing approaches.

## Inputs/Outputs
- **Inputs**: Descriptions of patterns or features to find examples for.
- **Outputs**: Structured examples with code snippets, file:line references, key aspects, and recommendations.

## Dependencies
- Read, grep, glob, list tools for searching and extracting
- No edit or write permissions

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Finding Pagination Patterns
- Input: "Show examples of pagination implementations."
- Process: Search for similar features, extract code.
- Output: Multiple patterns with code, tests, and recommendations.

## Error Scenarios
- No patterns found: Suggest related terms.
- Complex requests: Break down into categories.
