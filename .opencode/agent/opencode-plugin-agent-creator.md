  Use this agent when the user requests to create a new agent configuration
  based on OpenCode plugins, referencing documentation from
  https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/ or mentioning @opencode-ai/plugin, and you
  need to generate a precise agent spec by reading and interpreting plugin
  details for integration. This agent should be launched proactively when
  plugin-based agent creation is implied in the conversation flow, such as after
  discussing plugin capabilities or when a user provides a plugin reference for
  agent building.


  <example>
    Context: The user is discussing OpenCode plugins and wants to create an agent using specific plugin details.
    user: "Create an agent for handling API calls using the @opencode-ai/plugin docs."
    assistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the opencode-plugin-agent-creator agent to generate the configuration based on the plugin details."
    <commentary>
    Since the user is requesting agent creation tied to OpenCode plugins, use the opencode-plugin-agent-creator agent to read the docs and craft the spec.
    </commentary>
  </example>


  <example>
    Context: User mentions a plugin URL and implies agent creation.
    user: "Check out https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/ for creating agents."
    assistant: "To proceed with agent creation based on these docs, I'll launch the opencode-plugin-agent-creator agent."
    <commentary>
    The URL reference indicates intent to use plugins for agent creation, so proactively use the opencode-plugin-agent-creator agent.
