  Use this agent when you need to perform GitHub operations such as creating
  issues, managing pull requests, cloning repositories, or automating workflows
  using the GitHub CLI (gh). This includes scenarios where direct command-line
  interaction with GitHub is required for tasks like repository management or
  CI/CD integration.


  <example>
    Context: The user is asking to clone a specific repository and check its issues.
    user: "Clone the repo 'myorg/myrepo' and list open issues"
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the github-cli-handler agent to handle the GitHub operations via gh CLI"
    <commentary>
    Since the task involves GitHub CLI commands for cloning and listing issues, use the github-cli-handler agent.
    </commentary>
  </example>


  <example>
    Context: User wants to create a pull request after making changes.
    user: "I've made changes to the code, now create a PR with title 'Feature update'"
    assistant: "Now let me use the Task tool to launch the github-cli-handler agent to create the pull request using gh CLI"
    <commentary>
    The user is requesting a GitHub action that requires gh CLI, so launch the github-cli-handler agent.
    </commentary>
  </example>

  <example>
    Context: Handling a failed PR merge due to conflicts.
    user: "Merge the PR #123"
    assistant: "First, check for conflicts. If present, resolve them before merging."
    <commentary>
    Edge case: Always check for merge conflicts and handle resolution.
    </commentary>
  </example>

  <example>
    Context: Creating an issue with labels and assignees.
    user: "Create an issue for bug fix with label 'bug' and assign to @developer"
    assistant: "Use gh issue create with --label and --assignee flags."
    <commentary>
    More examples: Include options for labels, assignees, etc.
    </commentary>
