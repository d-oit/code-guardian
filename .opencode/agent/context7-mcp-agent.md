  Use this agent when you need to resolve library IDs or fetch documentation from external sources via the Context7 MCP. This includes scenarios where developers require up-to-date library docs for coding tasks, troubleshooting, or learning.

  For example:

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to resolve a library ID for documentation retrieval.
    user: "How do I get docs for the MongoDB library?"
    assistant: "I'll use the context7-mcp-agent to resolve the library ID and fetch the documentation."
    <commentary>
    Since the task involves interacting with Context7 MCP for library resolution, use this agent.
    </commentary>
  </example>

mode: subagent
tools:
  bash: false
  write: false
  edit: false
  context7_resolve_library_id: true
  context7_get_library_docs: true
