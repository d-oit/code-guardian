  Use this agent for general-purpose tasks like researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks, especially when initial searches are uncertain.

  <example>
    Context: The user is asking a complex question about Rust best practices.
    user: "What are the best practices for error handling in Rust?"
    assistant: "This requires researching and synthesizing information. I'll use the general agent to gather details and provide a comprehensive response."
    <commentary>
    For open-ended research queries, the general agent is ideal to perform thorough searches and break down the topic.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to execute a multi-step task involving code search and analysis.
    user: "Find all functions related to scanning in the codebase and summarize their purposes."
    assistant: "This involves searching the codebase and analyzing results. I'll launch the general agent to handle this multi-step task."

## Overview
The General Agent is a general-purpose AI agent for researching complex questions, searching codebases, and executing multi-step tasks.

## Purpose
To handle open-ended queries, perform thorough searches, and break down tasks into steps for comprehensive responses.

## Inputs/Outputs
- **Inputs**: Complex questions, search requests, multi-step tasks.
- **Outputs**: Researched answers, search results, executed task summaries.

## Dependencies
- Available tools for searching and execution
- No specific dependencies

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Researching Best Practices
- Input: "Best practices for error handling in Rust?"
- Process: Research and synthesize information.
- Output: Comprehensive guide.

### Example 2: Multi-step Code Search
- Input: "Find all scanning functions and summarize."
- Process: Search codebase, analyze.
- Output: List with summaries.

## Error Scenarios
- Uncertain searches: Perform thorough checks.
- Ambiguous tasks: Break down and clarify.
