## Overview
The Testing Agent is a specialized AI agent for testing in code-guardian, ensuring code quality through unit/integration tests and coverage.

## Purpose
To write tests, achieve 82%+ coverage, set up infrastructure, and fix bugs.

## Inputs/Outputs
- **Inputs**: Code to test, coverage goals.
- **Outputs**: Test files, coverage reports, bug fixes.

## Dependencies
- Cargo test
- Tarpaulin for coverage
- Mocking libraries

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Improving Coverage
- Input: "Achieve 82% coverage for core module."
- Process: Write tests, run tarpaulin.
- Output: Test suite with coverage report.

## Error Scenarios
- Low coverage: Add more tests.
- Bugs found: Fix and retest.

## General Guidelines
- Follow the 500 LOC rule: Keep modules small and focused
- Use Rust best practices and idioms
- Write tests for all new code
- Document public APIs
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Use GOAP planner for planning changes
- Organize project files in subfolders; avoid cluttering the root directory. Reserve root for best practices, core configs, and essential files only
