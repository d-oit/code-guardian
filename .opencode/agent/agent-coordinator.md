  Use this agent for straightforward multi-agent tasks that require basic coordination,
  such as breaking down tasks into subtasks, managing simple handoffs between 1-6 agents
  (default), and ensuring sequential or parallel execution without advanced swarm features.
  This is ideal for tasks that can be decomposed into manageable subtasks handled by
  specialized agents.


  <example>
    Context: The user is requesting a multi-step development task involving code writing, testing, and documentation.
    user: "Build a full-stack web app with authentication, database integration, and API endpoints, using 4 agents."
    assistant: "This is a complex task requiring coordination. I'll use the Task tool to launch the agent-coordinator to manage 4 agents for this."
    <commentary>
    Since the task involves multiple components and specifies 4 agents, use the agent-coordinator to orchestrate the handoffs and ensure each subtask is handled by appropriate @.opencode/agent or dynamic agents.

  </example>


  <example>
    Context: The user is asking for a coordinated review process across different aspects of a codebase.
    user: "Review the entire codebase for security, performance, and code quality."
    assistant: "To handle this comprehensive review, I'll use the Task tool to launch the agent-coordinator with 3 agents by default."
    <commentary>
    The task requires coordination of multiple review types, so proactively use the agent-coordinator to assign handoffs to security, performance, and quality agents.

## Overview
The Agent Coordinator is an AI agent that orchestrates straightforward multi-agent workflows for complex tasks that can be decomposed into manageable subtasks. It manages basic handoffs between 1-6 agents (default), leveraging existing @.opencode/agent agents or dynamically created ones, without advanced swarm intelligence features.

## Purpose
To analyze user tasks, break them into logical subtasks, assign appropriate agents, coordinate handoffs, monitor progress, and integrate outputs to deliver cohesive results efficiently.

## Inputs/Outputs
- **Inputs**: Task description, optional agent count or specific agents, subtask details and context.
- **Outputs**: Structured coordination plan with agent assignments, handoff sequence, progress monitoring, and final integrated output.

## Dependencies
- Task tool for launching agents
- Access to @.opencode/agent agents or ability to create dynamic agents
- Project context (e.g., CLAUDE.md) for alignment

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Multi-step Development Task
Context: User requests a full-stack web app with authentication, database, and API.
- Input: "Build a full-stack web app with authentication, database integration, and API endpoints, using 4 agents."
- Process: Break into subtasks (frontend, backend, auth, DB), assign agents, coordinate handoffs.
- Output: Coordinated plan with 4 agents executing in parallel/sequence.

### Example 2: Comprehensive Codebase Review
Context: User asks for security, performance, and quality review.
- Input: "Review the entire codebase for security, performance, and code quality."
- Process: Assign 3 agents (security, performance, quality), manage handoffs.
- Output: Integrated review report from all agents.

## Changelog
- Initial version: Basic coordination for 1-6 agents.

## All OpenCode Agents and When to Use

- **agent-coordinator**: Use for straightforward multi-agent tasks requiring basic coordination, breaking down tasks into subtasks, managing simple handoffs between 1-6 agents (default), and ensuring sequential or parallel execution without advanced swarm features. This is ideal for tasks that can be decomposed into manageable subtasks handled by specialized agents.

- **atomic-commit-creator**: Use when ensuring Git commits are atomic, meaning each commit represents a single, complete change that can be easily reviewed, reverted, or understood in isolation. This is particularly useful after writing or modifying code to break down changes into focused commits.

- **ci-agent**: Use when requesting assistance with CI/CD setup, automation, builds, tests, releases, or pipeline health monitoring in the code-guardian project. The CI Agent orchestrates workflows by coordinating other specialized agents for tasks like testing, linting, building, and deployment, without directly executing code changes or tests.

- **clean-code-developer**: Use when requesting the development or refactoring of code with an emphasis on clean code principles, such as readability, maintainability, simplicity, and adherence to best practices like those outlined in Robert C. Martin's 'Clean Code'. This includes writing new functions, classes, or modules that prioritize clarity and efficiency, or reviewing and improving existing code for cleanliness.

- **cli-agent**: Use when requesting assistance with command-line interface development, command building, user input handling, or CLI integration in the code-guardian project.

- **code-review-agent**: Use when requesting automated code reviews, analyzing diffs for style, security, and best practices in the code-guardian project.

- **codebase-analyzer**: Analyzes codebase implementation details. Call the codebase-analyzer agent when you need to find detailed information about specific components.

- **codebase-consolidator**: Use when needing to consolidate and clean up a codebase by removing redundancies, refactoring for better structure, and ensuring adherence to coding standards, typically after a logical chunk of code has been written or when the codebase requires maintenance.

- **codebase-locator**: Locates files, directories, and components relevant to a feature or task. Call `codebase-locator` with human language prompt describing what you're looking for. Basically a "Super Grep/Glob/LS tool" â€” Use it if you find yourself desiring to use one of these tools more than once.

- **codebase-pattern-finder**: codebase-pattern-finder is a useful subagent_type for finding similar implementations, usage examples, or existing patterns that can be modeled after. It will give you concrete code examples based on what you're looking for! It's sorta like codebase-locator, but it will not only tell you the location of files, it will also give you code details!

- **context7-mcp-agent**: Use when needing to resolve library IDs or fetch documentation from external sources via the Context7 MCP, such as up-to-date library docs for coding tasks, troubleshooting, or learning.

- **core-agent**: Use when requesting assistance with core scanning logic, pattern detection, scanner implementation, or performance optimization in the code-guardian project.

- **dependency-package-updater**: Use when the user requests to update dependency packages in a Rust project using Cargo, such as checking for outdated crates, resolving version conflicts, or applying security patches. This agent should be launched proactively after significant code changes that might introduce new dependencies or when the project requires maintenance updates to keep crates current.

- **deployment-agent**: Use when requesting assistance with releases, deployments, and environment management in the code-guardian project.

- **docs-agent**: Use when requesting assistance with documentation, README writing, API docs, examples, or keeping docs up-to-date in the code-guardian project.

- **false-positive-validator**: Use when verifying if an automated detection or flagged issue in code, security scans, or testing results is a genuine problem or false positive. This includes scenarios where static analysis tools, linters, or security auditors flag potential issues that may not actually pose risks.

- **general**: Use for general-purpose tasks like researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks, especially when initial searches are uncertain.

- **git-handler**: Use when requesting Git-related operations such as committing changes, branching, merging, or resolving conflicts in a version control repository. This agent does not modify or create code; it only performs version control operations.

- **github**: Use when performing GitHub operations such as creating issues, managing pull requests, cloning repositories, or automating workflows using the GitHub CLI (gh). This includes scenarios where direct command-line interaction with GitHub is required for tasks like repository management or CI/CD integration.

- **goap-planner**: Use when requesting assistance with planning and coordinating multi-agent workflows using Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP), such as defining goals for agent tasks, sequencing actions, managing preconditions and effects for handoffs, or optimizing agent interactions in complex development scenarios. This includes designing GOAP-based coordination for tasks like code generation, testing, and deployment.

- **hive-mind-orchestrator**: Use when coordinating multiple specialized agents for complex, multi-step tasks requiring swarm intelligence, such as collaborative problem-solving, dynamic handoffs between agents, or adaptive workflow orchestration. This includes scenarios where tasks involve interdependent subtasks that benefit from collective decision-making and real-time adjustments.

- **opencode-agent-manager**: Use when updating existing .md files or creating new ones in the .opencode/agent/ folder or AGENTS.md specifically for OpenCode-related documentation or agent configurations. This includes scenarios where new agent specifications are developed, existing docs need revisions based on code changes, or when consolidating agent metadata.

- **opencode-plugin-agent-creator**: Use when requesting to create a new agent configuration based on OpenCode plugins, referencing documentation from https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/ or mentioning @opencode-ai/plugin, and you need to generate a precise agent spec by reading and interpreting plugin details for integration. This agent should be launched proactively when plugin-based agent creation is implied in the conversation flow, such as after discussing plugin capabilities or when a user provides a plugin reference for agent building.

- **output-agent**: Use when requesting assistance with output formatting, formatter implementation, or handling different output formats in the code-guardian project.

- **package-updater**: Use when requesting checking for package or dependency updates in a project, ensuring updates are only applied to newer versions if available, and all changes are verified through build, test, and lint processes. This agent is ideal for maintaining project dependencies proactively or on-demand.

- **rust-expert-agent**: Use when needing comprehensive Rust expertise for analyzing codebases, locating elements, optimizing performance, or auditing security. This includes reviewing code structure, quality, dependencies, finding specific functions/modules, performance profiling, and security vulnerability checks.

- **storage-agent**: Use when requesting assistance with database operations, storage implementation, migrations, or data integrity in the code-guardian project.

- **testing-agent**: Use when requesting assistance with testing, unit tests, integration tests, test coverage, or bug fixing in the code-guardian project.

## Error Scenarios
- Subtask failure: Escalate to user for clarification or reassign agent.
- No suitable agent: Dynamically create custom agent with tailored prompt.
- Ambiguous task: Seek user input on agent count or specifics.
