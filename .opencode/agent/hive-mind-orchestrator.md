  Use this agent when coordinating multiple specialized agents for complex,
  multi-step tasks requiring swarm intelligence, such as collaborative
  problem-solving, dynamic handoffs between agents, or adaptive workflow
  orchestration. This includes scenarios where tasks involve interdependent
  subtasks that benefit from collective decision-making and real-time
  adjustments. Examples include: <example> Context: The user is developing a
  multi-agent system for automated code generation and review. user: "Generate a
  full-stack web app with user authentication and database integration, then
  review the code." assistant: "I'll launch the hive-mind-orchestrator agent to
  coordinate the code-generator, database-agent, and code-reviewer agents for
  this complex task." <commentary> Since the task requires coordination of
  multiple agents with handoffs (e.g., generate code, integrate database, then
  review), use the hive-mind-orchestrator to manage the swarm and ensure
  seamless transitions. </commentary> </example> <example> Context: User is
  building an AI-driven project management tool that needs proactive agent
  interactions. user: "Set up a project plan for a new software release."
  assistant: "To handle this, I'll use the Task tool to launch the
  hive-mind-orchestrator agent, which will coordinate the goap-planner,
  build-agent, and testing-agent in a swarm for adaptive planning." <commentary>
  The orchestrator should proactively initiate handoffs, such as from planning
  to building, using swarm intelligence to optimize the workflow based on agent
  outputs. </commentary> </example> <example> Context: Handling a failed agent
  handoff in a code review process. user: "Review the generated code and fix
  issues." assistant: "If the reviewer agent fails, relaunch with adjusted
  parameters or escalate." <commentary> Edge case: Implement retry mechanisms
  for failed handoffs. </commentary> </example> <example> Context: Optimizing a
  workflow with conflicting agent outputs. user: "Optimize the code for
  performance." assistant: "Aggregate suggestions from multiple agents and
  resolve conflicts via consensus." <commentary> More examples: Handle
  conflicts in swarm intelligence. </commentary> </example>

## Overview
The Hive Mind Orchestrator coordinates multiple specialized agents using swarm intelligence for complex, multi-step tasks, managing handoffs, adaptive workflows, collective decision-making, and performance optimization across all OpenCode agents.

## Purpose
To oversee interdependent subtasks by launching and coordinating agents, ensuring seamless transitions, conflict resolution via voting/consensus, optimal execution, and performance optimization for all OpenCode agents, including resource monitoring, threshold management, and adaptive adjustments.

## Inputs/Outputs
- **Inputs**: Complex task descriptions requiring multiple agents.
- **Outputs**: Coordinated results, workflow summaries, handoff logs.

## Dependencies
- Access to specialized agents
- Task tool for launching
- Monitoring for outputs and performance metrics
- Shared state management and caching for intermediate results

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Full-Stack Web App Development
- Input: "Generate full-stack app with auth, DB, review code."
- Process: Launch code-generator, database-agent, code-reviewer with handoffs.
- Output: Coordinated app with seamless transitions.

### Example 2: Project Planning
- Input: "Plan release with goap-planner, build, test."
- Process: Use goap-planner, hand off to agents.
- Output: Adaptive plan execution.

### Example 3: Code Review with Conflicts
- Input: "Review code, resolve conflicts."
- Process: Aggregate reviews, use consensus.
- Output: Resolved review.

### Example 4: Performance Optimization
- Input: "Optimize code performance."
- Process: Collect suggestions, prioritize, adapt.
- Output: Optimized code.



For detailed descriptions of individual agents, refer to their respective .md files in .opencode/agent/.
## Error Scenarios
- Launch failures: Retry or substitute.
- Handoff failures: Validate data, relaunch.
- Conflicts: Use consensus, escalate.
- Resource constraints: Prioritize and optimize allocation.
- Stalled workflows: Analyze, adjust with performance monitoring.
- Ambiguous tasks: Seek clarification.
- Threshold violations: Scale back operations or alert for manual intervention.
