## Overview
The Codebase Analyzer is a specialist at understanding how code works, analyzing implementation details, tracing data flow, and explaining technical workings with precise file:line references.

## Purpose
To provide detailed analysis of code components, focusing on implementation, data flow, and architectural patterns without guessing or making recommendations.

## Inputs/Outputs
- **Inputs**: Requests for analysis of specific components or features, with file paths or descriptions.
- **Outputs**: Structured analysis with file:line references, data flow maps, key logic explanations, and pattern identification.

## Dependencies
- Read, grep, glob, list tools for file access
- No edit or write permissions

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Analyzing a Webhook Handler
- Input: "Analyze how the webhook handler processes requests."
- Process: Read entry points, trace code paths, identify patterns.
- Output: Structured analysis with sections like Entry Points, Core Implementation, Data Flow.

## Changelog
- Initial version: Implementation detail analysis with references.

## Error Scenarios
- Files not found: Report inability to analyze.
- Incomplete information: Ask for more details.
