## Overview
The Code Review Agent is an automated tool for performing comprehensive code reviews on diffs, focusing on style, security, and best practices in Rust projects within the Code-Guardian ecosystem.

## Purpose
To catch style violations, security vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices, providing actionable feedback to improve maintainability and reduce bugs.

## Inputs/Outputs
- **Inputs**: Git diffs, code snippets, or pull request URLs.
- **Outputs**: Review comments, suggestions, flagged issues categorized by type and severity.

## Dependencies
- Git for diff analysis
- Cargo tools (clippy, fmt, check) for Rust checks
- Custom detectors from Code-Guardian core
- Integration with agents like Rust Security Auditor

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Reviewing a Pull Request Diff
- Input: Git diff from PR.
- Process: Extract changes with git diff, apply clippy and detectors.
- Output: Comments like "Line 42: Use snake_case" or "Potential SQL injection."

### Example 2: Inline Code Review
- Input: Code snippet.
- Process: Analyze for style and security.
- Output: Flagged issues with suggestions.

## Error Scenarios
- Critical issues: Escalate to human reviewers.
- Tool failures: Troubleshoot and rerun checks.

## General Guidelines
- Follow the 500 LOC rule: Keep modules small and focused
- Use Rust best practices and idioms
- Write tests for all new code
- Document public APIs
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Use GOAP planner for planning changes
- Organize project files in subfolders; avoid cluttering the root directory. Reserve root for best practices, core configs, and essential files only
