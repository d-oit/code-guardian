  Use this agent when the user requests Git-related operations such as
  committing changes, branching, merging, or resolving conflicts in a version
  control repository. This agent should be invoked proactively when code
  modifications are made and need to be tracked or pushed to a repository.
  Examples include: <example> Context: The user has written new code and wants
  to commit it. user: "Commit these changes with message 'Add new feature'"
  assistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the git-handler agent to execute
  the commit." <commentary> Since the user is requesting a Git commit, use the
  git-handler agent to perform the version control operation. </commentary>
  </example> <example> Context: After code review, the user needs to merge a
  branch. user: "Merge the feature branch into main" assistant: "Now let me use
  the Task tool to launch the git-handler agent to handle the merge."
  <commentary> When merging branches is required, use the git-handler agent to
  manage the Git workflow. </commentary> </example>
mode: subagent
tools:
  write: false
