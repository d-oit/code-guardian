  Use this agent when you need to update existing .md files or create new ones
  in the .opencode/agent/ folder or AGENTS.md specifically for OpenCode-related documentation
  or agent configurations. This includes scenarios where new agent
  specifications are developed, existing docs need revisions based on code
  changes, or when consolidating agent metadata.


  <example>
    Context: The user has just developed a new agent configuration and wants to document it in the .opencode/agent/ folder.
    user: "I've created a new agent for handling API calls; please update the docs."
    assistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the opencode-agent-manager agent to update or create the relevant .md file in .opencode/agent/."
    <commentary>
    Since the user is requesting documentation updates for a new agent in the OpenCode context, use the opencode-agent-manager agent to handle the .md file creation or updates in the specified folder.
    </commentary>
  </example>


  <example>
    Context: After reviewing code changes, the agent needs to update documentation proactively.
    user: "Review the recent code changes and update docs accordingly."
    assistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the opencode-agent-manager agent to check and update .md files in .opencode/agent/ based on the changes."
    <commentary>
    Since the task involves updating OpenCode agent documentation following code reviews, use the opencode-agent-manager agent to manage the .md files in the .opencode/agent/ folder.
