# Code Guardian Documentation

Welcome to Code Guardian, a comprehensive multi-language code analysis tool designed for production readiness and code quality assurance.

## What is Code Guardian?

Code Guardian is an advanced static analysis tool that helps developers and teams:

- **Detect Security Vulnerabilities**: Including AI-generated code vulnerabilities through specialized LLM detectors
- **Ensure Code Quality**: Performance anti-patterns, error handling issues, and maintainability concerns
- **Production Readiness**: Comprehensive scanning profiles for different deployment environments
- **Multi-language Support**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, SQL, and more

## Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Scanning
- Traditional security vulnerability detection
- **18 specialized LLM detectors** for AI-generated code vulnerabilities
- SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded credentials detection
- Cryptographic anti-pattern identification

### üìä Quality Assurance  
- Performance bottleneck detection
- Async/await pattern validation
- Error handling best practices
- Over-engineering pattern detection

### üöÄ Production Ready
- Multiple scanning profiles (development, staging, production)
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Comprehensive reporting in JSON, CSV, HTML, Markdown formats
- Configurable severity levels and thresholds

### ü§ñ LLM-Aware Scanning
- Detects hallucinated API calls commonly generated by LLMs
- Identifies insecure patterns in AI-generated code
- Validates LLM-generated comments for accuracy
- Ensures AI-assisted development maintains security standards

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Code Guardian
cargo install code-guardian

# Basic scan
code-guardian scan ./src

# Production-ready scan with LLM detection
code-guardian scan --profile production-ready-llm ./src

# Generate detailed report
code-guardian scan --format html --output report.html ./src
```
