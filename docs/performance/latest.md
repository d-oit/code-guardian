## Optimization Recommendations

### For Development
1. Use `make fast-check` for quick validation (saves 60% time)
2. Enable incremental compilation with `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`
3. Use `cargo-watch` for continuous testing
4. Configure IDE with rust-analyzer optimizations

### For CI/CD
1. Use parallel jobs per crate (implemented)
2. Cache cargo dependencies and target directory
3. Use sparse index for faster dependency resolution
4. Split long-running tests into separate jobs

### For Production Scanning
1. Enable streaming mode for large repositories
2. Use incremental scanning for regular scans
3. Configure appropriate memory limits
4. Enable parallel scanning on multi-core systems
