# Phase 6: Testing

## Overview
Develop comprehensive tests to ensure reliability and meet coverage goals.

## Sub-goals
- Write unit tests for all modules
- Write integration tests for end-to-end flows
- Achieve 80%+ code coverage

## Action Sequence
1. Write unit and integration tests
   - Precond: All modules implemented
   - Effect: Tests written: true
   - Effort: Medium-High
   - Description: Use cargo test, add tests to each crate. Cover edge cases, errors.

## Dependencies
- All previous phases

## Testing Recommendations
- Run cargo tarpaulin for coverage
- Continuous testing during development
- Mock external dependencies

## Potential Optimizations
- Property-based testing with proptest
- Fuzz testing for inputs
