# Phase 2: Core Functionality

## Overview
Implement the heart of the tool: pattern detection and scanning logic with parallel processing for performance.

## Sub-goals
- Define PatternDetector trait for extensible pattern matching
- Implement Scanner that uses parallel processing to scan codebases

## Action Sequence
1. Implement PatternDetector trait
   - Precond: Crate structure created
   - Effect: Core module implemented: true
   - Effort: Medium
   - Description: Define trait with methods for detecting TODO, FIXME, etc. Implement basic detectors.

2. Implement Scanner with parallel processing
   - Precond: PatternDetector implemented
   - Effect: Scanning logic complete
   - Effort: High
   - Description: Use rayon for parallel file scanning, aggregate results.

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Foundation

## Testing Recommendations
- Unit tests for pattern detection accuracy
- Integration tests for scanning directories
- Performance benchmarks for large codebases

## Potential Optimizations
- Lazy evaluation for patterns
- Caching for repeated scans
- Memory-efficient result aggregation
