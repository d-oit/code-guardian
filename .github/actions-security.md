# GitHub Actions Security Best Practices

## Summary
This document outlines the security enhancements implemented for GitHub Actions workflows in the code-guardian project.

## Implemented Security Enhancements

### 1. Least Privilege Permissions
- Added explicit permissions sections to all workflows
- Implemented minimal required scopes for each workflow type
- Used `security-events: write` for vulnerability reporting
- Used `packages: read` for dependency analysis

### 2. Security Scanning Integration
- Enhanced existing security workflow with comprehensive scanning
- Added SARIF report upload for GitHub Security tab integration
- Implemented vulnerability detection with cargo-audit and cargo-deny
- Added secrets detection with gitleaks and trufflehog

### 3. Immutable Release Practices
- Prevented release workflow cancellation (`cancel-in-progress: false`)
- Added explicit permissions for release operations
- Ensured releases are immutable once created

### 4. Vulnerability Detection and Reporting
- Created dedicated security-enhancements workflow
- Added SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- Implemented critical vulnerability threshold checking
- Added automatic issue creation for security incidents

### 5. Secrets Management
- Enhanced secrets detection patterns
- Added environment-specific secret handling
- Implemented credential leak prevention

## Workflow-Specific Security Configurations

### CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
- **Permissions**: `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`, `checks: write`, `packages: read`
- **Security Features**: Code review agent, clippy security checks

### Release Workflow (`release.yml`)
- **Permissions**: `contents: write`, `packages: read`
- **Security Features**: Immutable releases, multi-platform builds

### Security Workflow (`security.yml`)
- **Permissions**: `contents: read`, `security-events: write`, `actions: read`, `packages: read`
- **Security Features**: Comprehensive scanning, license compliance, secrets detection

### Auto-fix Workflow (`auto-fix.yml`)
- **Permissions**: `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`
- **Security Features**: Auto-formatting, clippy fixes with security checks

### Enhanced CI Workflow (`enhanced-ci.yml`)
- **Permissions**: `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`, `checks: write`, `actions: read`, `security-events: write`, `packages: read`
- **Security Features**: Comprehensive security scanning, performance benchmarking

### Security Enhancements Workflow (`security-enhancements.yml`)
- **Permissions**: `contents: read`, `security-events: write`, `packages: read`, `actions: read`
- **Security Features**: Vulnerability scanning, dependency security, SBOM generation

## Security Thresholds and Enforcement

### Vulnerability Thresholds
- **Critical**: 0 vulnerabilities allowed
- **High**: 0 vulnerabilities allowed
- **Medium**: 5 vulnerabilities allowed
- **Low**: 10 vulnerabilities allowed

### Code Quality Thresholds
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 82%
- **Clippy Warnings**: 0 warnings allowed
- **Unsafe Code**: 0 unsafe blocks allowed

## Incident Response
- **Auto-create Issues**: Enabled for critical security findings
- **Notification Channels**: GitHub Issues
- **Escalation Times**: Critical (24h), High (48h), Medium (7d)

## Security Tools Integration

### Cargo Tools
- `cargo-audit`: Vulnerability scanning
- `cargo-deny`: Dependency security analysis
- `cargo-clippy`: Security-focused code analysis

### External Tools
- `gitleaks`: Secrets detection
- `trufflehog`: Credential scanning
- GitHub Security Tab: SARIF report integration

## Monitoring and Reporting
- **Daily Workflow Monitoring**: Automated failure detection
- **Security Summary Reports**: Comprehensive status reporting
- **Artifact Uploads**: Security reports stored as artifacts

## Future Security Enhancements
- Implement dependency vulnerability alerts
- Add container security scanning
- Integrate with external security services
- Implement code signing for releases

## Compliance Standards
- Follows GitHub Actions security best practices
- Implements principle of least privilege
- Enables immutable release practices
- Provides comprehensive security reporting
