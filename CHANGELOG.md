## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **üåç Multi-Language Non-Production Code Detection**: Added 13 new detectors for finding non-production code across 30+ programming languages
  - **Development/Phase Patterns**: `Dev`, `Debug`, `Test`, `Phase`, `Staging` 
  - **Non-Production Code**: `ConsoleLog`, `Print`, `Alert`, `Debugger`, `UnusedVar`, `DeadCode`, `Experimental`
- **üéØ Production-Ready Detector Profile**: New comprehensive profile specifically for production readiness scanning
- **üì± Language-Specific Detection**: Smart filtering (e.g., console.log only detected in JS/TS files, alerts in web files)
- **‚öôÔ∏è Enhanced Multi-Language Support**: Extended support for 30+ file extensions including TypeScript, Python, C#, Go, PHP, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Scala, and more
- **üìã Production Configuration Template**: Complete `examples/production_ready_config.toml` with severity levels and custom patterns
- **üìñ Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed `examples/production_ready_scan_demo.md` with usage guides for multi-language scanning
- **‚úÖ Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Integration tests demonstrating multi-language detection across JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, and Go

### Enhanced
- **üîß Extended DetectorType Enum**: Added 13 new detector types with appropriate severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **üè≠ Enhanced DetectorFactory**: New `create_production_ready_detectors()` method and `ProductionReady` profile
- **üìÅ Expanded File Support**: Default configuration now includes 30+ file extensions for comprehensive language coverage
- **üé® Improved Regex Patterns**: Optimized detection patterns for better accuracy across different programming languages

### Technical Improvements
- All new detectors follow Rust best practices with comprehensive error handling
- Language-specific filtering prevents false positives (e.g., console.log not detected in Python files)
- Smart test file exclusion (TestDetector skips actual test directories)
- Backward compatible - no breaking changes to existing API
